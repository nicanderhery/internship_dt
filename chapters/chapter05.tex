\label{ch:conclusion}

My internship at dataTactics GmbH was a valuable learning experience that provided me with insights into software development, web development, and working in a tech company. Throughout the internship, I worked on the Ops-Edge project, a cloud-based application designed to streamline incident reporting and management in large environments. I gained hands-on experience with various technologies and tools, including Python, Flask, React, Mantine, and Socket.IO\@. I also learned how to integrate external data sources into the application to provide real-time updates and insights using a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) Apache Camel. I also improve my knowledge not only in technical skills, but also in soft skills and professional development.
