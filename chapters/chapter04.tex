\section{Key Learnings}
\label{sec:conclusion:key_learnings}

My internship at dataTactics GmbH provided me with valuable insights into software development, web development, and working in a tech company. Some of the key learnings from my internship include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full-stack development:} I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, working on both the backend and frontend components of the Ops-Edge project. This experience helped me understand the end-to-end development process and the challenges involved in building a complete application.
    \item \textbf{Various Tech-Stacks:} I learned how to use various technologies and tools in the development of Ops-Edge, including Python, Flask, React, Mantine, and Socket.IO\@. I gained experience in building RESTful APIs, user interfaces, and real-time communication features.
    \item \textbf{Problem Solving:} I developed my problem-solving skills by tackling various technical challenges during the internship. This included analyzing problems, identifying solutions, and implementing them effectively.
    \item \textbf{Time and Project Management:} I learned how to manage my time effectively to meet project deadlines and deliver high-quality work. I improved my ability to prioritize tasks, set goals, and stay organized throughout the internship.
    \item \textbf{Communication:} I improved my communication skills by discussing project requirements with my colleagues, sharing updates on my progress, and seeking feedback on my work.
    \item \textbf{Continuous learning:} I developed a growth mindset and a passion for continuous learning. I realized the importance of staying updated with the latest technologies and trends in the software development industry.
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges Faced}
\label{sec:conclusion:challenges_faced}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integrating with the external services:} Although the integration process was simple I faced difficulties when working with Apache Camel and its XML configuration language. Since I was unfamiliar with Apache Camel beforehand it required some time to understand how it operates and set it up to meet the projects needs.
    \item \textbf{Blurry map when zoomed:} The project makes use of the \href{https://deck.gl/}{DeckGL} library for creating maps, with layers taken from \href{https://www.openstreetmap.org/}{OpenStreetMap}. However I faced a problem where the map looked blurry when zoomed in unlike the clear details visible on OpenStreetMap. Even after trying methods finding a solution, to this issue has proven difficult.
\end{itemize}
