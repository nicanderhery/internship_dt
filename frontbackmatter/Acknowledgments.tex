\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to dataTactics GmbH for providing
me with the opportunity to participate in the Ops-Edge project as an intern.
This experience has been invaluable in allowing me to gain practical experience
in the field of web development and to apply the knowledge I have gained
throughout my studies.\\

I am particularly grateful to my supervisor, Matthias R. Leinweber, for his
guidance and support throughout the internship. His expertise and advice have
been invaluable in helping me to develop my skills and to work effectively on
the project.\\

In addition, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire dataTactics team
for their warm welcome, collaboration, and willingness to share their
expertise. Their support throughout the project has been invaluable.
